                        <p>
                            NRG Retail is comprised of a team committed to creating a different kind of energy company direct
                            to the customer. By leveraging emerging
                            technologies and partnerships, NRG is working to become the thought leader in the energy space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Philadelphia office is tackling the job of transforming how people think about, and purchase, energy.
                            By disrupting the system of monolithic utilities which only have a one size fits all model, we envision
                            a more nimble future where customers have meaningful energy choices.  With choice we can deliver value
                            to customers where none exists now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our people and systems connect our customers to the best mileage and points reward programs in
                            the market.  Currently this loyalty platform sets NRG apart, but it is just a step in the
                            direction we are heading.  Our exclusive and one-of-a-kind relationships with over a hundred
                            partners allows us to custom tailor products that
                            will drive innovation in the retail energy space.  We are constantly working on new products
                            and services and are looking for people to come join us to change retail energy.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h4>Why work at NRG Retail?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Let's be honest here; like every company that went a thousand miles an hour for a couple years,
                            there is legacy code.  Our legacy code takes the form of a LAMP stack that powers sections of
                            our corporate and marketing infrastructure as well as .NET platform that is our Ops and CRM.
                            Like an old Buick, it's comfortable and gets everyone where they need to go, but there are miles
                            on it and maintenance isn't worth it (or fun) anymore.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So why on earth would you want to work here?  Because we have been given the high five to
                            start core systems over again.
                            We've introduced a new sales system using (the now coined) MEAN stack and a new loyalty-awarding
                            platform in python with celery and flask.  The legacy CRM is being decommissioned,
                            and the LAMP stack is seeing a new future as a CMS with rich APIs for core Marketing needs.
                            New core systems we must build for the future of NRG Retail, are lightweight decoupled (and API-driven)
                            using Python, Rabbit/Celery, and AWS.  Our work will power NRG Retail for the future.  Wander down to the <a href="#open-positions"> Jobs </a>

                            little of our philosophy.

                            NRG Retail is looking for team oriented full stack web developers to join us.
                            Ideally we're looking for 2-5 years experience as an in-depth full stack developer who can take an idea,
                            create and communicate with wireframes, and code a fully tested app end-to-end with data stores,
                            buttons for customer to click, and APIs that bring everything together.
                            Hence "full stack".  Our team is always evolving with technology so a love of
                            learning and experimenting is a must, and comfort in a fast paced environment is a key.
                            Specialization is for insects, not software development.

                            NRG Retail is looking for a PHP developer who isn't afraid to get their hands dirty.  We're
                            always making changes to our current PHP stack (Which is fairly large) as well as work with
                            the project teams to add and enhance what the PHP is currently doing.  Person must be team focused
                            and can take ideas from the whiteboard through wireframes, and ultimately deliver high quality
                            software the first time.  Experience with creating rich APIs is a plus, but more important is the
                            understanding of decoupled system designs and having the ability to execute the design.  Our team is
                            fast paced and loves technology so a love of learning and experimenting is a must.
