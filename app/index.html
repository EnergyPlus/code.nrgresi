                        <p>
                            NRG is comprised of a team committed to creating a different kind of energy company.  By leveraging emerging
                            technologies and partnerships NRG is positioned to become the thought leader in the energy space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our local Philladelphia office is tackling the job of transforming how people purchase energy.  By disrupting the system of monolithic utilities with a one size fits all approach, to a more nimble future where customers have meaningful choices, we can deliver value to customers where none exists now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our people and systems connect our customers to the best mileage and points reward programs in the market.   Currently this loyalty platform sets us apart, but it is just a step in the direction we are heading.  Our
                            exclusive and one-of-a-kind relationships with over a hundred partners allows us to custom tailor products that 
                            will drive innovation in the retail energy space.  We are constantly working on new proucts and services and are looking for people to come join us to change retail energy.

                        <h4>Why work at NRG Retail?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Let's be honest here: like every company that went a thousand miles an hour for a couple years, there is legacy code.  Our legacy code takes the form of a LAMP stack that powers sections of our corporate and marketing infrastructure as well as .NET platform that is our Ops and CRM.  Like an old Buick, it's comfortable and gets everyone where they need to go, but there are miles on it and maintenance isn't worth it (or fun) anymore.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So why on earth would you want to work here?  Because over the past year we've changed.  We've introduced a new sales system using (the now coined) MEAN stack and a new awarding platform in python on Flask.  We're re-platforming our .NET stack over the next year and want to throw out as much as possible.  This work will power NRG Northeast Retail for the future, and we're starting right today.  Wander down to the <a href="#open-positions"> Jobs </a> section to see what we have open, or take a look at some of what we're working with and a little of our philosphy.

                            Our space is office free, casual dress, and we get free soda.  There's usually food floating around, so that's clutch at times.  We have a Starbucks machine (really we need two) and there's a Han Dynasty downstairs.  Dan dan noodles...they cannot be denied.

                        We are an Agile team using Scrum, as well as TDD and BDD, to deliver high quality products and features to support NRG Northeast Retail.  We do not subscribe to one technology, we choose to use the proper tools for the problem at hand.  We're coders and designers, not operations experts, so we want to operationalize everything so we have more time to code.
