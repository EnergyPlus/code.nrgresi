                        <h4>Who we are</h4>
                        <p>
                            NRG is comprised of a team committed to creating a different kind of energy company.  By leveraging emerging
                            technologies and partnerships, NRG is positioned to become the thought leader in the energy space.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our local Philadelphia office is tackling the job of transforming how people purchase energy.  By disrupting the system of monolithic utilities with a one size fits all approach we envision a more nimble future where customers have meaningful choices.  With choice we can deliver value to customers where none exists now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our people and systems connect our customers to the best mileage and points reward programs in the market.   Currently this loyalty platform sets us apart, but it is just a step in the direction we are heading.  Our
                            exclusive and one-of-a-kind relationships with over a hundred partners allows us to custom tailor products that
                            will drive innovation in the retail energy space.  We are constantly working on new products and services and are looking for people to come join us to change retail energy.

                        <h4>Why work at NRG Retail?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Let's be honest here; like every company that went a thousand miles an hour for a couple years, there is legacy code.  Our legacy code takes the form of a LAMP stack that powers sections of our corporate and marketing infrastructure as well as .NET platform that is our Ops and CRM.  Like an old Buick, it's comfortable and gets everyone where they need to go, but there are miles on it and maintenance isn't worth it (or fun) anymore.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So why on earth would you want to work here?  Because over the past year we've changed.  We've introduced a new sales system using (the now coined) MEAN stack and a new loyalty awarding platform in python with celery and flask.  We're re-platforming our .NET stack over the next year with a charter from the business to get lean and go fast.  New lightweight systems are online using Python, rabbit and Celery.  Our work will power NRG Retail for the future.  Wander down to the <a href="#open-positions"> Jobs </a> section to see what we have open, or take a look at some of what we're working with and a little of our philosophy.

                        <p>
                            NRG Retail is looking for a couple team oriented full stack web developers to join us. Ideally we're looking for 2-5 years as an in-depth full stack developer who can take an idea, create and communicate with wireframes, and code a fully tested app end-to-end.  Hence "full stack".  Our team is always evolving with technology so a love of learning and experimenting is a key, and comfort in a fast paced environment is a key. Specialization is for insects, not software development.

                        <p>

                                <li>Experience turning comps and wireframes into code</li>
                                <li>Strong ability to decompose requirements into unit tests</li>
                                <li>Strong Python, data processing skills</li>
                                <li>Strong HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills</li>
                                <li>Experience with MySQL and/or SQL Server</li>
                                <li>Strong working knowledge of AWS</li>
                                <li>Experience with Linux and Git</li>
                            </ul>
